    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a Master's student at the University of Turku, currently diving deep into Data Analytics and ML infrastructure.
        My daily toolkit revolves around Python, SQL, and Power BI, but my tech stack goes well beyond that.
        Right now, I'm focused on developing efficient data pipelines, creating impactful data visualizations, and building my own home server infrastructure on the side.
        I have a huge passion for space technology, and my ultimate goal is to work as a Data Engineer in the space industry.
